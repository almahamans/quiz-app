# quiz-app
## Description
It is a simple quiz form.
I did this project as am learning accessibility from (FreeCodeCamp)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-accessibility-by-building-a-quiz/step-1]. 
## Thoughts
I found this project helpful in practcing my skills in styling in general and creating html forms.
I learned about ARIA attribute which used to help with people who use screen readers also appling best practice.
I did not put my personal tuoch I only applied what they suggest and I had fun!
